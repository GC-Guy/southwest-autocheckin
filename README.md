Southwest-Autocheckin
=====================

Yet another southwest checkin web-based system. Register your southwest/swa flights and the system will checkin for you _automatically 24hrs before departure_.

Go to [springyleap.com](http://springyleap.com) to try it out.

This system was inspired out of the original work by [Joe Beda's script](https://github.com/jbeda/southwest-checkin) and [Aaron Ortbals herokuapp](https://github.com/aortbals/southwest-checkin) southwest automatic checkin script and webapp respectively.

The system is compatible with the latest changes done by the Southwest team in Late September'14 (redesign of their website and API). This is a live project, and I keep updating it regularly to offer more functionality and/or fix issues find by its users. If you find any issues, please report them [here](mailto:flightautocheckin@sybleu.com) or raise an issue in this project.

__This system is for personal use only__.
